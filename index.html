              <p> Monica and Joey were originally meant to end up together, but the

            co-creator and executive producer Marta Kauffman explained to The
            Hollywood Reporter that a lot of aspects of the show changed as
            natural chemistry developed between cast members.</p>

            <p>"You set out to do
            things, and then actors come in and they breathe life into it, and
            it's not quite what you imagined it was going to be," Kauffman said.
            For instance, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Chandler (Matthew Perry)
            were only supposed to get together briefly before she was set to end
            up with Joey (Matthew LeBlanc). But when Monica and Chandler did get
            together on screen, viewers responded so enthusiastically to the
            pairing that the Joey and Monica plotline was discarded. "We were
            stunned," Kauffman said. "So that's when we sort of went, 'Huh,
            guess this is going in a different direction.'"</p>

            Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc wanted Phoebe and Joey to have a secret
            long-running affair. Kudrow (who played Phoebe Buffay) and LeBlanc
            shared that they had pitched an ending to the producers where Phoebe
            and Joey were revealed to have been sleeping together throughout the
            series. "Towards the end we actually pitched the idea that Joey and
            Phoebe had been having casual sex the entire time," LeBlanc said.
            "We'd go back and shoot all the historical scenes and just before a
            moment that everyone recognizes, there's Joey and Phoebe coming out
            of a broom closet together." He said producers passed on this
            plotline.

              “Long ago before Friends was Friends, when it was in its infancy, 
              it was a show called Friends Like Us, and I was being considered for a role, 
              like a goth girl, which I think morphed into Phoebe.”

            Phoebe and Chandler were written as supporting roles. Hank Azaria (Phoebe's David) auditioned for the role of Joey.
            Twice. It's okay. He was destined to play David and go to Minsk for a really long time. 
            The creators wanted Courteney Cox to play Rachel.
              Jane Lynch and Kathy Griffin both auditioned for Phoebe.
              Rachel was originally supposed to propose to Joshua right after Ross got engaged. Can you even imagine?</p>

            Jon Favreau (Pete) originally auditioned for Chandler.
            But don't worry, Favreau's still got a soft spot for Pete after all these years. “Pete Becker was a man of tremendous focus and conviction. He set his heart to being the Ultimate Fighting Champion and I have no doubt that he gave it his all. I'm only sorry that that chapter was never closed by the Friends writers because I'll always have to live with the uncertainty of what his fate held.”

It's a cliche to say that an actor makes a role their own, but in Matthew's case, there are no truer words. From the day we first heard him embody the role of Chandler Bing, there was no one else for us. We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment – not just to his work, but in life as well. He was always the funniest person in the room.
              More than that, he was the sweetest, with a giving and selfless heart. 
              We send all of our love to his family and friends.

              "Thank you for ten incredible years of laughter and creativity.

I will never forget your impeccable comic timing and delivery. You could take a straight line of dialogue and bend it to your will, resulting in something so entirely original and unexpectedly funny it still astonishes. 

And you had heart. Which you were generous with, and shared with us, so we could create a family out of six strangers.

This photo is from one of my favorite moments with you. Now it makes me smile and grieve at the same time.

I imagine you up there, somewhere, in the same white suit, hands in your pockets, looking around—

"Oh boy this one has cut deep... Having to say goodbye to our Matty has been an insane wave of emotions that I've never experienced before. We all experience loss at some point in our lives. Loss of life or loss of love. Being able to really SIT in this grief allows you to feel the moments of joy and gratitude for having loved someone that deep. And we loved him deeply. He was such a part of our DNA. We were always the 6 of us. This was a chosen family that forever changed the course of who we were and what our path was going to be. For Matty, he KNEW he loved to make people laugh. As he said himself, if he didn't hear the ‘laugh' he thought he was going to die. His life literally depended on it. And boy did he succeed in doing just that. He made all of us laugh. And laugh hard. In the last couple weeks, I've been poring over our texts to one another. Laughing and crying then laughing again. I'll keep them forever and ever. I found one text that he sent me out of nowhere one day. It says it all. (See the second slide…) 

Matty, I love you so much and I know you are now completely at peace and out of any pain. I talk to you every day… sometimes I can almost hear you saying “could you BE any crazier?” 

Rest little brother. 
You always made my day…

You suggested we play poker  AND made it so much fun while we initially bonded. Thank you for that.

Thank you for your open heart in a six way relationship that required compromise. And a lot of “talking.”
Thank you for showing up at work when you weren't well and then, being completely brilliant.

"I am so grateful for every moment I had with you Matty and I miss you every day.

When you work with someone as closely as I did with Matthew, there are thousands of moments I wish I could share. For now here's one of my favorites. 
To give a little backstory, Chandler and Monica were supposed to have a one night fling in London. But because of the audience's reaction, it became the beginning of their love story. 
In this scene, before we started rolling, he whispered a funny line for me to say. 
He often did things like that. He was funny and he was kind. 🤍🕊️".

“He had a gentleness and generosity of spirit that was unparalleled. I learned how to tell a joke perfectly just by watching him work. And I will never forget the moment he leaned in, on my first night of taping Friends, to tell me warmly, ‘get ready for your life to change.' Rest well, Matthew Perry. Thank you for the kindness and laughter.”

“A lot of us who were close to him felt like we lost him to drugs and alcohol a long time ago because — as he documented in his autobiography — there was so much suffering, I had to pick up and put down that biography, like, 11 times, it was so painful for me to read. I'm a sober guy for 17 years, and I wanna say that, the night I went into AA, Matthew brought me in. The whole first year I was sober, we went to meetings together. He was so caring and giving and wise. And he totally helped me get sober. And I really wish he could've, you know, found the – found it in himself to stay with the silver life more consistently.”

"I'm heartbroken about the untimely death of my “son”, Matthew Perry. The loss of such a brilliant young actor is a shock. And such a sweet, caring man, too! I’m sending love and condolences to his friends and family, especially his dad, John Bennett Perry, who I worked with on Falcon Crest & Flamingo Rd. Lovely family and such a heavy loss! #ripmatthewperry #ripmatty 💔💔💔"

“Matthew and I had been friendly long before Friends. So, when I guest stared as Zach, the prospective sperm donor for Chandler and Monica, I hung with him a lot. Standing backstage, ready to make my entrance, Matt whispers, 'The audience is going to go crazy when they see you! Get ready for some loud screams.' I walk through the door… silence. I was so embarrassed. We finish the scene and as I start to slither back to my dressing room and quit showbiz, Matt walks over to the studio audience: 'Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for John Stamos! You guys probably didn't recognize him at first because he's so much better looking in person!'”
