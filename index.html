        ON THIS WEBSITE

        We say
        "HOW YOU DOIN?"
        "Pivot! Pivot! Pivot!"
        and "WE WERE ON A BREAK!"

        WE BELIEVE IN UNAGI
        lobster soulmates,
        and smelly cats.

        THEY DON'T KNOW THAT
        WE KNOW THEY KNOW WE KNOW...
        This is not a moo point

        But I'll be there for you

        BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE
        FOR ME TOO

      The pilot episode focuses on Rachel Green, a sheltered but friendly woman who flees on her wedding day and finds her childhood friend she hasn't seen in years Monica Geller, a tightly wound but caring chef.

      In the very first season of the show, Rachel becomes a waitress at West Village coffee house Central Perk. She moves into Monica's apartment above the coffee house and joins Monica's group of single friends in their mid-20s: previous roommate Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric, weird masseuse; neighbor Joey Tribbiani, a dim-witted yet loyal struggling actor and womanizer; Joey's roommate Chandler Bing, a sarcastic, self-deprecating IT manager; and Monica's older brother and Chandler's college roommate Ross Geller, a sweet-natured but insecure paleontologist.

      Episodes depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking jobs in the fashion industry. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show, they repeatedly date and break up.
      
      Over the course of the series, Ross briefly marries Emily, Ross and Rachel have a child together after a one-night stand, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents Jack and Judy Geller from Long Island; Ross's ex-wife Carol Willick, their son Ben Geller, and Carol's lesbian partner Susan Bunch; Central Perk barista Gunther; Chandler's extremely annoying and obnoxious but good-natured ex-girlfriend Janice Goralnik; and Phoebe's evil twin sister Ursula.
